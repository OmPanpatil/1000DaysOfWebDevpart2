        Operators in java
        Arithmetic, Relational operator, Logical operator, Bitwisae operator, Assignment operator

        Relational operator:
        ==
        equal to - equal to==> it helps to operates as the relation between the operands 
        if the condition gets satisfy it will states as trues and if not it is false.
        
        != 
        not equal to ==> it always the opposite of the equal to(==) 
        if the condition is true it will states as false and if true it will states as true.

        > 
        greater than it shows which is greater than the other operand

        <
        less than it shows which is greater than the operands

        <=
        less than or equals to

        >=
        Greater than or equal too


                Logical operator

                (&&)Logical and operator:
                when there is only both the value is true in the logic then only the loghisc will be true otherwise it will be false in every condition.

                Statement1(true) && Statement2(true) ==> True
                
                
                (||) Logical OR operator:
                when the value from both the statement will be true then the whole condition will be true but
                if two of the statements are false then the whole condition is false.

                Statement1(false) || Statement2(False) ==> False

                (!) logical Not Operator :
                true to false
                and false to true.

                for example:
                Sout( !(5>0))

                output: False


                        #Assignment operator:
                        (=) where the value get assigned from one to another through this sign "="
                        int a = b
                        if a=10 and b=5 then a become 5 after assigning.

                        (+) where a can be a = a+10 in competitive we can write as a+ = 10;
                        a=20

                        (-) where a can be a- = 10;

                        (*) where b can be b* = 5; b=25

                        (/) where b can be b/ = 5; 0 remainder is 0.

        System.out.println( (3>2) && (1>0));
